Project 1: Building a mobile app with focus on experiential learning on Abundance-related practices; to be published on both Android and iOS platforms

Project 2: An Edutainment/Content delivery website with focus on sharing events, resources and content related to ‘Abundance’, ‘Wealth teachings’ and our Global movement

Slack channel for requirements discussion/queries:

For the content delivery website, the host would be www.beingabundance.org. The master requirements sheet for the website is placed here:

If you want to add a new requirement for the mobile application or website, you can speak with the core team on the Slack channel. We are somewhat selective when deciding to add a new requirement/function now and the best way to contribute and help the project is to work on existing requirements.
